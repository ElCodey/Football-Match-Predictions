# Football-Match-Predictions

Data from: http://football-data.co.uk

A project where I will use logistic regression to train a model based on the previous 3 football seasons. With stats from every premier league game, with an outcome of: "W", "L", and "D". The input for the model will be the lastest season, with only the team names given.
In sport, generally the home team will have a decent percentage of the wins. So the model will need to be trained to beat that baseline value, which will be explored at the start. The new season will have 3 promoted teams, which could cause some problems if those teams were not previously seen before during training.
